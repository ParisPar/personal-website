To see the website live you can go to http://paraskevas.info/

# Installation
First run `$ npm install` to get the Node.js dependencies.

Then simply run `$ gulp` to output production code in the `dist` folder.  
This will also start a web server at http://localhost:8000/ with the live reloading feature enabled.
